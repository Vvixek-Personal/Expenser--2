/**
 * Each release is anchored to a REAL, FIXED calendar date (set once, the day it shipped) — never
 * to "now minus N days". The previous version computed every release's date from
 * System.currentTimeMillis() on every app launch, which meant "Yesterday" silently became "2 days
 * ago", then "3 days ago", forever, and the release's displayed calendar date itself drifted
 * forward a day at a time instead of staying fixed at when it actually shipped.
 *
 * `epochDay(year, month, day)` below builds a fixed UTC-midnight timestamp for a release date.
 * `relativeLabel(timestamp)` computes "Today" / "Yesterday" / "N days ago" / a calendar date for
 * anything older than a month, freshly, from that FIXED timestamp compared to the real current
 * time — so the label correctly advances day by day instead of being wrong forever.
 *
 * To ship a new release: add ONE new epochDay(...) anchor with today's real date. Never reuse
 * "now" for a release's timestamp.
